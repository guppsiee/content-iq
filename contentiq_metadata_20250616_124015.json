It gives the ability to drill down into \nyour data and the processes that it follows, such as \nthe automation you\u2019ve created. There are two ways to \ndo this: process mining and task mining. The core \nfunction of process mining involves extracting \ndata from systems of records (SOR) or other sources. \nOn the other hand, task mining captures user \ninteraction or desktop data, enabling businesses to \nanalyze and enhance their work processes. Users \ninitiate the recording of small processes or tasks, \noften in conjunction with process mining for a \ncomprehensive perspective. \nBy gaining what you could call an x -ray of your \nbusiness, you gain insights into what those processes \nlook like and most importantly, where bottlenecks \nexist and where rework is happening. Once \nbottlenecks and inefficiencies are identified, a plan can \nbe prepared to address and alleviate these issues. \nHowever, the process of data analysis and reporting \ncan be lengthy \u2014often a period of three -to-four months \u2014to understand what\u2019s happening in the \nexisting processes using traditional techniques.
